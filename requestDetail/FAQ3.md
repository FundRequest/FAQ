When you see the claim button but are unable to press it, it means the issue is resolved, but you are not considered to be the solver. If you are the solver and you still can't press the claim button, make sure you have linked your GitHub account to your FundRequest profile. You can verify this [here](https://fundrequest.io/profile). 

If you still experience problems feel free to contact support, [support@fundrequest.io](mailto:support@fundrequest.io).

Requests are funded using tokens that exist on a blockchain. To receive rewards, a developer needs an account on the Ethereum blockchain, dubbed an ETH Address. When a developer claims a reward, it will be sent to his ETH address. 

If you do not have an ETH address yet, you can create one using [MyEtherWallet](https://MyEtherWallet.com) or [MyCrytpo](https://mycrypto.com).

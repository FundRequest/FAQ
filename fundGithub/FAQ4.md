If it is the first time you use FundRequest, you'll be offered 2 transactions when trying to fund a request. The first one is for you to allow FundRequest to access the token you want to use for payment. This is a necessary step, since we need to let the smart contract know that you approve funding with, e.g., FND.  This transaction is required only the very first time you fund an issue. We promise. The second transaction is the one that will allocate your funds to the request.
